Used a [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/eligibility-prediction-for-loan/data), prepared to data for analysis, and then applied Decision Tree Classifier and NB Classifier Machine learning algorithms with scikit-learn library to check for best accuracy. Finally predicted Loan eligibility for the customers based on their income, education level, etc.
